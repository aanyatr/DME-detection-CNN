# DME-detection-CNN
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), caused due to diabetes, is an advanced symptom of diabetic retinopathy and can lead to vision loss.

The ratio of ophthalmologists to the population in developing countries like India is 1:25,000 .Hence, there is a need for automatic detection of DME.

Therefore, the goal of this project, is to classify the several grades of DME by using a CNN model (trained from scratch) with higher accuracy.

To detect and classify Diabetic Macular Edema the steps are as follows:
1. We perform data collection, by selection of our datasets which are IDRID and Messidor Datasets.

2. Perform data pre-processing and data augmentation (steps such as resizing, flipping the images).

3. Implement a CNN model, trained from scratch that classifies DME into its three grades with higher accuracy by introdcuing novelty in the methodology.
